1.  all the paths in my project is relative so plz check that
2.  i have used Visual Studio Code during Devlopement process
3.  before running the project copy all the train and test folders from the orignal data set to Dataset Folder inside fruits-360

Steps 1 :- 
Run the Feature_extraction.py file
it will genrate all the batch files inside the train folder (Already files in train folder if not want to run)


Step  2  :- 
Execute the ML_models.py file to calculate all the results you have to manually change the target algo inside the file by changing the path
then it will save an python object file in the result folder 

step 3 :- 
you can read result file with the help of printresult.py file

Get_data.py file only contain the code to read all the batch from csv and convert it inot a single dataset.

all the results are stored as object in the result folder if you only wants to read the result just lunch the printresult.py file
